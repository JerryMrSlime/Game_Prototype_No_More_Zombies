Last week I was bored so I decided to make a prototype of a game. This code is from the prototype of the game though I finished the game. To finish it, I used flash, but I don't want to share that code.
All classes I used are on a single file. I know I should not do that because it's more difficult to make a big game but I started this project as a prototype not as a complete game.
I don't know why I am explaining this here, to finish I want to say that you can use all the code of this repository as you want, if you want to sell a game made with this game, you may do it though I would like to receive credits or something like that...
Enjoy of this fluffy thing :3
